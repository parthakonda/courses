# Understanding `var`, `let` and `const`

As you know that Javascript is not strict type based. And it is very easy to understand the data types.

However, `var` was the only data type present in ES2015 and later `let` and `const` added.

### var

- Used for declare a variable
- Optionally you can initialize value

### let

- Used for declare a variable
- Optionally you can initialize value

### const

- Used for declare a variable
- Optionally you can initialize value

Wait,

`var`, `let` and `const` are same? then why we need to use 3 of them?
